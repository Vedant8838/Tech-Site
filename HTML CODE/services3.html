    <h1>Data Backup & Recovery</h1>
    <p>Data backup and recovery is the process of making copies of data and restoring it if it's lost or damaged. </p>
    <ul>
     <br><br>
        <h2>Types of backups</h2>
        <li>Full backup: Copies all data in a single operation. </li>
        <li>Incremental backup: Copies only the data that has changed since the last backup. </li>
        <li>Differential backup: Copies only the data that has changed since the last full backup. </li>
        <li>Mirror backup: Creates an exact copy of the data.</li>
         <br><br>
         <h2>Benefits of data backup </h2>
         <li>Protects against data loss due to malware, hard disk drive failure, or natural disasters</li>
         <li>Helps prevent theft or accidental deletion</li>
         <li>Minimizes storage space and backup time</li>
            <h2>Data recovery</h2>
            <p>Restoring lost, corrupted, or accidentally deleted data to a computer, mobile device, or storage device. </p>

            <h2>• Backup Appliance</h2>
            <p>A "backup appliance" is a dedicated hardware device that combines storage and backup software into a single unit, designed specifically for storing and managing backup data, often including features like data deduplication, compression, encryption, and automated backup processes, essentially providing a self-contained system for data protection and disaster recovery purposes. </p>
            <ul>
                <h2>Key points about backup appliances:</h2>
                <li>Purpose-built:</li>
                <p>They are optimized solely for backup operations, unlike general-purpose servers that might also handle other workloads. </p>
                <li>Integrated software:</li>
                <p>Most backup appliances come with pre-installed backup software, simplifying setup and management. </p>
                <li>Scalability:</li>
                <p>Many backup appliances can be expanded by adding additional storage modules to accommodate growing data volumes. </p>
                <li>Data protection features:</li>
                <p>Features like deduplication, compression, and encryption help to minimize storage space needed and enhance data security. </p>

                </ul>
                <br><br><br>

                <h1>• Backup Software</h1>
                <p>Backup software is a computer program that copies your data and files to a separate location. This can be an external device, cloud storage, or a separate hard drive. </p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <h2>Why use backup software?</h2>
                    <li>Data loss: Backup software can help you restore your data if your computer is damaged by hardware failure, accidental deletion, software corruption, or natural disasters. </li>
                    <li>Data integrity: Backup software can help ensure that your data is available and has not been corrupted. </li>
                    <li>Data integrity: Backup software can help ensure that your data is available and has not been corrupted. </li>
                    <br><br>

                        <h2>How does backup software work?</h2>
                        <li>Backup software can create copies of your files, folders, or your entire system. </li>
                        <li>Advanced backup software can allow you to create multiple backups. </li>
                        <li>Backup software can help you schedule, launch, and manage the backup process. </li>

                        </ul>
                        <h1>• Storage – NAS</h1>
                        <p>Network-attached storage (NAS) is a device that stores and shares files over a network. It allows multiple users to access data from a single location. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <h2>How does NAS work?</h2>
                            <li>NAS devices are servers that are connected to a network via Ethernet or WiFi. </li>
                            <li>NAS devices store data on hard drives and use Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) to distribute and duplicate data across multiple disks. </li>
                            <li>NAS devices are designed to be fault tolerant, meaning they can continue to function even if some of the drives fail. </li>
                            <br><br>

                            <h2>What are the benefits of NAS?</h2>
                            <li>NAS provides a single access point for storage, making it easy for users to collaborate. </li>
                            <li> NAS is scalable, so you can add more storage as your needs grow. </li>
                            <li>NAS is affordable and easy to maintain. </li>
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <h2>What are some uses for NAS? </h2>
                            <li>Backing up data</li>
                            <li>Archiving data</li>
                            <li>Disaster recovery</li>
                            <li>Hosting applications</li>

                             <p>A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a high-speed network that connects servers to storage devices. It centralizes storage devices to make them easier to manage and communicate with. </p>
                             <ul>
                                <br><br>

                                <h2>How does a SAN work?</h2>
                                <li>SANs are made up of storage devices, switches, and cabling. </li>
                                <li>SANs use fiber channel interconnects. </li>
                                <li>SANs present block storage to multiple networked systems as if they were locally attached devices. </li>
                                <li>SANs allow servers to access shared storage as if it were a drive directly attached to the server. </li>
                                <br><br>

                                <h2>Benefits of a SAN </h2>
                                <li>SANs improve performance and availability.</li>
                                <li>SANs increase utilization rates.</li>
                                <li>SANs isolate failures.</li>
                                <li>SANs allow for granular control of access to storage resources.</li>
                                <li>SANs make it possible to consistently apply security policies and encryption.</li>
                                <br><br>

                                <h2>SAN use cases</h2>
                                <p>SANs are commonly used by enterprises for performance-critical applications that require low latency and high throughput. They are used to store an organization's vital customer data. </p>
