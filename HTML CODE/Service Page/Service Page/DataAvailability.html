        <h4 class="u-text u-text-palette-1-base u-text-1">Data Availability</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> In today’s world maintaining the integrity of data and its function is indisputable. In today’s environment, data and application availability are critical for the continued operation of every business. Any network downtime can extract high cost from your business both in terms of time and money. Infoserve understands this and provides data availability solutions for business continuity.<br>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Data Pluse Solution provides Data availability services and integrated Data Services like enterprise backup, recovery software, appliances, disk to disk backup, de-duplication, e-discovery and offsite data vaulting solutions. Our backup & recovery practice are the foundation of a modern data management system. This allows administrators to work more efficiently by simplifying the management of data assets. Our systems are optimized to protect data wherever it resides, i.e. physical, virtual, and in the cloud.<br>
           <h5 class="u-text u-text-palette-1-base u-text-1">Solution Offerings</h5>
        <li class="u-text u-text-2">Backup and recovery Solutions: Backup is a process where copy of your data is created, while recovery is process where in case you lose data in unforeseen circumstances, you can recover your data from the stored backup. Data backup and recovery is a starting point for a holistic disaster recovery. In addition to backing up and safeguarding data, we, at Infoserve solutions, ensure that your applications that utilize data are up and running in record time during times of outage  </li>
        <li class="u-text u-text-2">Data Archive: Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate data storage device for long-term retention. The explosive growth of data emphasizes the reliance on information systems in various industries. Enterprise data becomes an important intangible asset for each enterprise, but how to manage the data effectively and efficiently remains unanswered.Data archiving solutions can minimize users’ operating costs, simplify the retrieval to key information, reduce underlying storage expenditure, and meet law-compliance requirements.  </li>
        <li class="u-text u-text-2">Disaster Recovery: There are many varied threats to business-critical systems. Natural disasters like flooding and fire, along with people factors, such as a disgruntled employees or human error that lets in a virus, make it essential to have a disaster recovery plan for business continuity. We understand the importance of your data and business information. Also we understand that the traditional disaster recovery solutions are costly and complex and cannot meet the objectives of a business. Infoserve disaster recovery plans let businesses recover data to any machine, reducing hardware costs and lowering the complexity of maintaining a backup site.  </li>
        <li class="u-text u-text-2">Business continuity: Business continuity is the activity performed by an organization to ensure that critical business functions will be available to customers, suppliers, regulators, and other entities that must have access to those functions. These activities include many daily jobs such as project management, system backups, change control, and help desks. Business continuity refers to those activities performed on a daily basis to maintain service, consistency, and recoverability, not something that is implemented at the time of a disaster.  </li>
        <li class="u-text u-text-2">Data Leakage Prevention: Data Pluse Solution provides Data Leakage or Loss Prevention solutions by identifying, monitoring, and protecting the data in use, data in transit and data at your servers. We help organizations in protection by recommending products and solutions by continually inspecting the security analysis of each transaction with a centralized management architecture.  </li>
