      <h1>Data Center</h1>
    <p> Data Center technology is improving every day. New servers allow for higher densities than ever before, putting
        great strains on legacy cooling and power products. In response, corporations need to intelligently allocate
        resources to get the most from their data center infrastructure. Optimizing your current environment with the
        right cooling and power infrastructure will help you reclaim precious capacity and may allow you to delay or
        avoid altogether the time and expense required to build a new data center. Optimizing data center infrastructure
        can achieve immediate results through increased capacity. In the long run, finding the right infrastructure for
        your data center can save money through reduced CAPEX and OPEX costs.</p>

<h1> Network Swithches/Routers</h1>
<p>Network switches and routers are networking hardware that connect and route data between devices.
     Switches are used to connect devices on a single network,
      while routers move data between networks. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Also known as Ethernet switches, network switches connect devices on a single Lan
        <li> They are restricted to wired network connections</li>
        <li> They are part of the data-link layer of the OSI model</li>
        <li> They use MAC addresses to transfer data to the correct destination</li>
        <li> They are less sophisticated than routers </li>
        <li> They are restricted to wired network connections</li>
    </ul>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Routers</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>They are primarily Layer 3 devices on the OSI model</li>
     <li>They move data between two or more computer networks</li>
     <li>They can work within both wired and Wi-Fi networks</li>
     <li>They use IP addresses to determine the route and destination of a packet</li>
     <li>They offer network address translation, NetFlow, and quality of service</li>

   <h1> Server-Storage</h1>
     <p>Server storage is a place to store data that is not in use.
        It is important to store data in a permanent solution,
        such as a storage area network (SAN), cloud storage,
        network-attached storage (NAS), or direct-attached storage (DAS). </p> 
   
    <h2>Types OF Server-Storage</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Backup server
        A server that stores important data, files, folders, databases, and hard drives </li>
    <li>Multimedia server
        A server that provides services to clients over a series of networks </li>
    <li>Storage dedicated server
        A server with enhanced storage capacities for businesses that 
        manage large volumes of data </li> 
     <li>Hybrid storage
        A system that combines flash-based solid-state drives
         (SSDs) and mechanical hard-disk drives (HDDs) </li>

    <h1> Structured Cabling ‚Äì Copper/Fiber for Data & Voice</h1>
     
      <p>structured cabling is a standardized approach to designing and installing
         a flexible cabling system that supports multiple hardware uses 
         and can adapt to future network requirements. It is essential for 
         reliable data and voice communication in commercial and industrial environments.</p>
         <ul>
            <h2>Types of Structured Cabling</h2>
        
         <li>1. Copper Cabling (Twisted Pair ‚Äì Ethernet)</li>
         <li>2. Fiber Optic Cabling</li>

         <br>
         <li>1. Copper Cabling (Twisted Pair ‚Äì Ethernet)</li>
         <p>Copper cabling is widely used for LAN (Local Area Network)
             connections and telephone systems.

            Common Types of Copper Cables:
            Cat5e (Category 5e) ‚Äì Supports up to 1 Gbps over 100 meters.
            Cat6 (Category 6) ‚Äì Supports up to 10 Gbps over 55 meters, with better interference resistance.
            Cat6a (Category 6a) ‚Äì Enhanced version of Cat6, supports 10 Gbps over 100 meters.
            Cat7 & Cat8 ‚Äì Higher speed and shielding for industrial and high-performance data centers.</p>

            <li>2. Fiber Optic Cabling</li>
            <p>Fiber optic cables transmit data using light, offering higher
                 bandwidth and speed over longer distances compared to copper.

                Types of Fiber Cables:
                Single-Mode Fiber (SMF) ‚Äì Best for long distances
                 (up to 40 km+), used in telecommunications.
                Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF) ‚Äì Used for shorter distances
                 (up to 550m), ideal for enterprise networks and data centers.</p>

            <h1> Wireless</h1>
             <ul>
                <p>While structured cabling (copper & fiber) forms the backbone
                     of network infrastructure, wireless networking (Wi-Fi)
                      plays a crucial role in providing flexible and mobile connectivity.</p>
                      <li>1. Wireless Technologies in Networking</li>
                      <P>Wireless networking eliminates the need for physical
                         cables while maintaining high-speed data transmission.</P>
                         <li>2. Wireless Access Points (APs) & Controllers</li>
                         <p>Access Points (APs): Extend Wi-Fi coverage in buildings.
