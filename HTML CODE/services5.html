            <h1>• Desktop / Server Virtualizatio</h1>
            <li>Desktop and server virtualization are technologies that create a software-based, or "virtual," version of a computer's operating system and applications, allowing users to access their desktop environment from any device.</li>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Key points about desktop virtualization:</h2>
                <p>Centralized access:</p>
                <li>Users access their virtual desktop environment through a network connection to a central server, meaning they can log in from any device with internet access. </li>
                <p>Improved management:</p>
                <li>IT administrators can easily manage and update all virtual desktops from a single location. </li>
                <p>Flexibility:</p>
                <li>Users can personalize their virtual desktop environment with specific applications and settings. </li>
                <br>

                <h2>Key points about server virtualization:</h2>
                <p>Resource allocation:</p>
                <li>A single physical server can be partitioned into multiple virtual servers, allowing for efficient allocation of computing resources based on application needs. </li>
                <p>High availability:</p>
                <li>If one virtual server fails, other virtual servers running on the same physical hardware can remain operational. </li>
                <p>Scalability:</p>
                <li>Businesses can easily add or remove virtual servers as needed without purchasing new physical hardware. </li>

             </ul>
             <br><br><br>
                
                <h1>• Link / Server Load balancer</h1>
                <li>A "link load balancer" distributes network traffic across multiple WAN connections (like different internet service providers), while a "server load balancer" distributes traffic across multiple servers within a data center, essentially ensuring that no single server or network link becomes overloaded and improving overall system availability and performance. </li>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Key points about link load balancers:</h2>
                    <p>Function:</p>
                    <li>Manages traffic flow across various internet connections to optimize bandwidth usage and prevent single points of failure. </li>
                    <p>Where used:</p>
                    <li>Typically positioned between a local area network (LAN) and the wider internet, distributing traffic across multiple ISP links. </li>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Key points about server load balancers:</h2>
                    <p>Function:</p>
                    <li>Distributes incoming requests from clients across a pool of available servers, ensuring efficient utilization of server resources. </li>
                    <p>Where used:</p>
                    <li>Within a data center, directing traffic to different application servers based on their current load and availability. </li>
                    
                 </ul>
                 <br><br><br>

                    <h1>• Cloud Computing</h1>
                    <li>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. It allows users to access computing resources like storage, servers, and software on-demand. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2>Benefits of cloud computing </h2>
                        <li>Cost savings: Users only pay for what they use, which can lower operating costs</li>
                        <li>Efficiency: Users can run their infrastructure more efficiently</li>
                        <li>Scalability: Users can scale resources up and down as their business needs change</li>

                     <br><br><br>

                        <h1> • SIEM</h1>
                        <li>SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It's a security management system that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). SIEM helps organizations identify and respond to security threats. </li>
