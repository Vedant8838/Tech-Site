        <h4 class="u-text u-text-palette-1-base u-text-1"> Structured Cabling System</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Structured cabling system is a kind of open network structure, which can be used by various systems such as data, telephony, access control, building automation and so on. It provides great flexibility and economical operation. Generally, structured cabling system can be divided into six parts: work area, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, equipment room, and telecommunication closet (room) and entrance facilities.<br> 
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Having Internet access in a commercial building is no longer an option. It is a must. That means every commercial building needs some sort of structured cabling system and many of them require a full wiring closet or server room including racks, panels, patch cords, lightning protectors, routers, switches, and media converters, all supported by a staff of IT professionals. Even if you are doing most of your file sharing and other network activities in the cloud, you can’t get by without the basic cable linking your office to an ISP.
